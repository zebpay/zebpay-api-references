# Zebpay Futures ‚Äî Developer Documentation

The **Zebpay Futures** product offers two complementary integration surfaces:

1. **REST API** ‚Äì programmatic access for placing orders, querying account information and retrieving market data.
2. **Webhooks** ‚Äì push-style notifications to automate trading strategies triggered by external events.

This directory contains documentation, client libraries and examples for both surfaces.
